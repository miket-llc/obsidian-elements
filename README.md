# Obsidian Sample Plugin

This is an Obsidian plugin to add meetings, contacts, and workflow to Obsidian (https://github.com/miket-llc/obsidian-elements).

This project is experimental and may be subject to change without notice.

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.
